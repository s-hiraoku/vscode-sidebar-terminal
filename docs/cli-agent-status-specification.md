# CLI Agent Status Management Specification

## Overview
This document describes the status management behavior for CLI Agents (Claude Code and Gemini) in the Secondary Terminal extension.

## Status Types

### 1. CONNECTED
- **Definition**: The CLI Agent is actively running in the terminal and is the globally active agent
- **Condition**: Only ONE terminal can have CONNECTED status at any time
- **Visual Indicator**: Shows as "ðŸŸ¢ Connected" in the terminal status

### 2. DISCONNECTED  
- **Definition**: The CLI Agent is running in the terminal but another terminal has the global active status
- **Condition**: Multiple terminals can have DISCONNECTED status
- **Visual Indicator**: Shows as "ðŸŸ¡ Disconnected" in the terminal status

### 3. NONE
- **Definition**: No CLI Agent is running in the terminal
- **Condition**: Default state for all terminals without CLI Agents
- **Visual Indicator**: No status indicator shown

## Status Transition Rules

### Starting a CLI Agent
1. When a CLI Agent (Claude Code or Gemini) is started in a terminal:
   - That terminal's status becomes **CONNECTED**
   - If another terminal was previously CONNECTED, it transitions to **DISCONNECTED**
   - Only the most recently started CLI Agent has CONNECTED status

### Stopping a CLI Agent
1. When a CONNECTED CLI Agent is terminated:
   - That terminal's status becomes **NONE**
   - If any DISCONNECTED terminals exist, one of them automatically becomes **CONNECTED**
   - Priority: The most recently started DISCONNECTED agent becomes CONNECTED

2. When a DISCONNECTED CLI Agent is terminated:
   - That terminal's status becomes **NONE**
   - No other status changes occur

## Key Invariants

1. **Single CONNECTED Rule**: At most ONE terminal can have CONNECTED status
   - 0 CONNECTED terminals: When no CLI Agents are running
   - 1 CONNECTED terminal: When at least one CLI Agent is running

2. **No All-DISCONNECTED State**: If any CLI Agents are running, at least one must be CONNECTED
   - It's impossible to have all terminals in DISCONNECTED state
   - When the last CONNECTED agent terminates, a DISCONNECTED agent (if any) automatically becomes CONNECTED

3. **Latest Takes Priority**: When multiple CLI Agents are running, the most recently started one gets CONNECTED status

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Terminal
1. Start Terminal 1 â†’ Status: NONE
2. Start CLI Agent in Terminal 1 â†’ Status: CONNECTED
3. Stop CLI Agent in Terminal 1 â†’ Status: NONE

### Scenario 2: Multiple Terminals
1. Start Terminal 1 with CLI Agent â†’ T1: CONNECTED
2. Start Terminal 2 with CLI Agent â†’ T1: DISCONNECTED, T2: CONNECTED
3. Start Terminal 3 with CLI Agent â†’ T1: DISCONNECTED, T2: DISCONNECTED, T3: CONNECTED
4. Stop CLI Agent in Terminal 3 â†’ T1: DISCONNECTED, T2: CONNECTED, T3: NONE
5. Stop CLI Agent in Terminal 2 â†’ T1: CONNECTED, T2: NONE, T3: NONE

### Scenario 3: Automatic Promotion
1. Terminal 1 with CLI Agent: CONNECTED
2. Terminal 2 with CLI Agent: DISCONNECTED  
3. Terminal 3 with CLI Agent: DISCONNECTED
4. Stop Terminal 1's CLI Agent â†’ Terminal 3 (most recent) automatically becomes CONNECTED

## Implementation Notes

- The extension maintains a global state tracker for all CLI Agent instances
- Status changes are propagated to both the Extension host and WebView for UI updates
- The automatic promotion logic ensures consistent behavior when CONNECTED agents terminate
