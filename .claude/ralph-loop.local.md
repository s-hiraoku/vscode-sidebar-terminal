Use the code-simplifier agent again on the current codebase to make it even simpler, cleaner, and more elegant. Focus on removing any remaining complexity, improving readability, and following best practices. Preserve all tests and functionality. When you believe it's maximally simplified, output exactly: <DONE>MAX_SIMPLIFIED</DONE>
