# Integration Test Framework for Refactored Terminal Management System

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive integration test framework specifically designed for the refactored terminal management system. The framework provides:

- **Service Composition Testing** - Validates that all injected services work together correctly
- **End-to-End Workflow Testing** - Tests complete user scenarios from terminal creation to deletion
- **Event Flow Validation** - Monitors and validates event coordination between services
- **Performance Monitoring** - Tracks resource usage and memory leaks during tests
- **Error Handling Verification** - Ensures graceful error handling across service boundaries

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. IntegrationTestFramework.ts

The main framework that provides:

- **MockServiceFactory** - Creates mock implementations of all services with realistic behavior
- **EventFlowTracker** - Monitors event flow between services and validates proper sequencing
- **PerformanceMonitor** - Tracks memory usage and detects leaks during test execution
- **Test Environment Setup** - Configures VS Code test environment with proper mocks

#### 2. TerminalManager.integration.test.ts

Comprehensive tests for `RefactoredTerminalManager`:

- Service composition and dependency injection validation
- Complete terminal lifecycle testing (create â†’ use â†’ delete)
- CLI Agent detection integration across services
- Error handling across service boundaries
- Performance under service composition
- Concurrent operations without race conditions

#### 3. Provider.integration.test.ts

Integration tests for `RefactoredSecondaryTerminalProvider`:

- WebView resolution and resource management
- Message routing and event coordination
- Configuration flow and settings management
- Service composition within provider context
- Resource cleanup and memory leak prevention

## Key Features

### Service Composition Testing

The framework validates that the refactored architecture maintains the same functionality as the original code while providing improved maintainability:

```typescript
// Example: Testing service composition
const terminalManager = new RefactoredTerminalManager(
  mockLifecycleManager,
  mockCliAgentService,
  mockBufferingService,
  mockStateManager
);

// Verify services work together
const health = terminalManager.getServiceHealth();
framework.validateServiceHealth(health);
```

### Event Flow Validation

Tracks and validates event flow between services:

```typescript
eventTracker.startTracking();

// Perform operations
terminalManager.createTerminal();
terminalManager.focusTerminal(terminalId);

// Validate event sequence
const expectedEvents = ['create-start', 'create-end', 'focus-start', 'focus-end'];
eventTracker.validateEventSequence(expectedEvents);
```

### Performance Monitoring

Continuously monitors performance and memory usage:

```typescript
// Memory leak detection
const { result, duration } = await framework.measureOperation('terminal-creation', () =>
  terminalManager.createTerminal()
);

// Validate performance thresholds
expect(duration).to.be.lessThan(100, 'Operation should be fast');
performanceMonitor.checkMemoryLeak(512); // Max 512KB increase
```

### Error Isolation Testing

Verifies that service failures don't cascade:

```typescript
// Make one service fail
(mockLifecycleManager.createTerminal as sinon.SinonStub).throws(new Error('Service failure'));

// Other services should still function
const stats = terminalManager.getPerformanceMetrics();
expect(stats.bufferingStats).to.exist; // Buffering service still works
```

## Test Configuration

### Framework Configuration

```typescript
const framework = await setupIntegrationTest('Test Name', {
  enablePerformanceMonitoring: true,
  enableMemoryLeakDetection: true,
  enableEventFlowTracking: true,
  maxOperationTime: 1000,
  maxMemoryIncrease: 512,
  eventTimeoutMs: 5000,
});
```

### Performance Thresholds

- **Service Initialization**: < 200ms
- **Terminal Operations**: < 100ms
- **Memory Increase**: < 1024KB during test
- **Event Processing**: > 20 events/sec throughput

## Running Integration Tests

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Run integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# Run performance tests only
npm run test:performance

# Run both integration and performance tests
npm run test:refactored

# Run all tests (unit + integration + performance)
npm run test:all
```

- Red-Green-Refactor cycle adherence
- Comprehensive coverage of user scenarios

### 2. Realistic Mock Behavior

Mock services provide realistic behavior:

- Event emitters for proper event flow
- Asynchronous operations where appropriate
- Error conditions for robustness testing

### 3. Performance Validation

Every test includes performance validation:

- Operation timing measurements
- Memory usage monitoring
- Throughput requirements verification

### 4. Error Handling Testing

Comprehensive error scenario coverage:

- Graceful degradation testing
- Recovery mechanism validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Timeouts**
   - Increase timeout values in test configuration
   - Check for hanging promises in async operations

2. **Memory Leak Warnings**
   - Verify all services are properly disposed
   - Check for retained event listeners

3. **Event Flow Validation Failures**
   - Ensure proper event timing in tests
   - Verify mock service event emission

### Debug Output
