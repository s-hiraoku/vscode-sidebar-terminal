/**
 * Performance Tests for Buffer Management - Following t-wada's TDD Methodology
 *
 * NOTE: This test file has been disabled because it tests methods that don't exist
 * on the current PerformanceManager implementation. It needs to be rewritten to
 * match the actual API or the missing methods need to be implemented.
 *
 * Missing methods include:
 * - bufferOutput (should be bufferedWrite)
 * - clearBuffer (should be clearBuffers)
 * - bufferOutputWithAgentDetection
 * - cleanupOldBuffers
 * - setBufferSizeLimit
 * - onBufferOverflow
 * - And many others...
