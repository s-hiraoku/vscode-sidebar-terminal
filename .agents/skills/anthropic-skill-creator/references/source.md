## Key points reflected in this skill

- Trigger quality is primarily controlled by frontmatter description.
- Progressive disclosure should be used to keep context efficient.
- Skills should be tested across triggering, functional behavior, and performance impact.
- Under-triggering and over-triggering should be fixed iteratively using real failed prompts.
- Fragile workflows should be made deterministic using scripts where possible.
